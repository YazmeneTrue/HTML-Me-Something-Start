        <h3>Painting</h3>
           
    <p> One of my favortie things to do is create. I love to paint. I am more of a traditional artist because the love the feel of working and feeling with my hands. Although, I recently got myself an Ipad to dive deeper into digital art. I also started to sculpt with clay which can get messy.</p>
        <h3>Sculpting</h3>

    <p> I recently been dabbling at making sculptures. I just want to make cool knick knacks. I love the ones that look like food but have functionality, it's so hilarous to me. My goal is to make baking items like clay cakes.</p>
        <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>Writing has been something that I have been doing my entire life. I loved the part in school where we could just write freely and tell stories. Today, I journal like crazy and use it as a way to gain a deeper connection with myself. Creating stories help me reach into my imagination and bring to life everything that I want even if I can not physically attain it at the moment.</p>
