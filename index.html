            <h2>&hearts;ABOUT ME&hearts;</h2>
            <p>Welp, I was going to write a long extensive bio but then I thought "whaaaa???".
                Crazy to think I coded this whole website for me to spill all the tea in the Homepage. I could let you know my age
                 but you should never question a woman's age. I mean you guys should at least know what I look like. So, I may drop a few pics or
                  I may not. It really depends on if I eat my peferable meal today and today it happens to be a grinder sandwhich. 
                  "Whats a grinder sandwhich?", Yall dont know? Just playing I just found out what it was on that clock app
                   and I have been itching to make it ever since. We may have to explore that in <a href="food.html">food </a>.</p>
